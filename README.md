# Water Reminder Notification

This is a simple Python program that sends a Windows notification every 15 seconds to remind the user to drink water. The notification contains information about the importance of water and its benefits to the body.

## Requirements

To run this program, you need to have Python 3 installed on your Windows computer. You also need to install the `win10toast` module to send Windows notifications. You can install it using the following command:

```
pip install win10toast
```

## Usage

To run the program, simply open a command prompt or terminal, navigate to the directory where the program is saved, and type the following command:

```
python water_reminder.py
```

The program will start sending notifications every 15 seconds until you manually stop it by pressing `Ctrl + C`.

## Modification

You can modify the program to customize the message, title, or icon of the notification. Simply edit the values of the `message`, `title`, and `app_icon` parameters in the code.

## Note

This program is intended as a fun project to learn about Windows notifications and Python programming. It is not intended as medical advice. Please consult a qualified healthcare provider for any questions or concerns about your health.
